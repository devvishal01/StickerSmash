# Sticker Smash

Sticker Smash is a simple app built with Expo that allows users to add predefined stickers to their photos and save the edited images to their phone's media gallery. This project served as an introduction to React Native components and gesture-based photo editing.

## Features

- **Photo Editing**: Add predefined stickers to your photos.
- **Gesture-Based Controls**: Use gestures to adjust and position stickers on the photo.
- **Save to Gallery**: Save the edited photos directly to your phone's media gallery.
